                                   BUGS:

1)  backend → vacation-model → in the date section, check if the date is "date" type 
    or "string" type. ==> string!

2)  backend + database → how to add admin to the database ==> Hardcoded!

3)  backend → how to make the date aper without the time. it changes the date because of the
    the time zone. ==> ask google.

4)  backend → logic&controller → add new vacation and delete are full of bugs..

                            IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

1)  When clicking on a vacation card - there will be a pop-up that describes:
    A.  extra different things about the place.
    B.  current wether at the location + the wether at the location on the dates of the
        vacation.
    C.  more photos of the vacation (Add arrows to the image square with which you can
        browse through the images).
    
2)  At the navbar or below it add a filter option selection.
